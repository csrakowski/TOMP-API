# CITYWAY
## Description
Cityway is a France-based MaaS-operator that helps Transport Authorities to implement mobility data warehouses and then build local MaaS apps on top of it. Our historical technological strength is our transit trip planner, multi-modal and predictive. We are working on aggregating mobility offers in given areas and create a mobility account that simplifies mobility for the traveler.
<p> Here we created a generic Partner API in order to industrialize the integration of new Transport Operators.

## Mobility Account / Partner API
The mobility account is one of our newest product (live in Mulhouse & beta-phase in Saint-Etienne - France).

## It gives access to a lot of Transport Operators :
* Unlocking a shared-car or a shared bike,
* Lifting the gate at a parking lot
* Using public transportation tickets

<p> The traveler then pays one bill for all usages at the end of the month. He can monitor his consumptions during the month and soon he’ll be able to buy “mobility packages”.
<p> In order to gather all those services in one app, we have to integrate the web services of all partners/transport operators.

<p>For this we created a Partner API that helps us standardize communications with partners/transport operators.

<p>We are here to take good ideas and share already implemented one in our projects.
