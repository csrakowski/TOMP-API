The TOMP WG consists out of 4 sub-work groups. Each workgroup has its own roadmap, but these consist mostly out of internal milestones. For the API itself these are the milestones we want to reach for:

![TOMP-API roadmap 07/24](https://github.com/TOMP-WG/website/blob/master/wiki/images/Roadmap%202025.png?raw=true)

```
2020 Q3: version 1.0 - released. Milestone 'Dragonfly'. First implementations have been done.  
 
2020 Q4: version 1.1 - released. Containing changes with respect to GBFS 2.0  

2021 Q2: version 1.2, containing the first changes to cope with a MaaS ecosystem - personal information.  
       - Operator module extension, possibly with 'terms and conditions' and 'known cards/memberships'  

2022 Q1: version 1.3, changes to cope with MaaS ecosystem - Interoperability with GTFS-GOFS,  
         verifying personal information using blockchain.

2022 Q4: version 1.4, additional functionality, dependent on requests from the market:
        - simplifying the booking process (alternative booking process)
        - integration with other standards (GBFS, GTFS, NeTEx, APDS, ...)

2023 Q4: version 1.5, additional functionality
        - added use case library
        - improved trip execution (and specification of necessary steps)
        - extra search facilities

2024 Q4: version 1.6 (planned), with additional functionality:
        - added some functions for publishing terms & conditions
        - draft version of customer account management
        - small improvements for trip execution & support

2025: version 2.0, milestone 'Elephant'
        - Transmodel based
        - possibility to buy products
        - 'conventional' public transport functions like revoking tickets, reimbursements, 
          and offers for cancellation.
        - revised Blueprint

2025-2030: 
        - Interoperability with other domains, like electricity and logistics
        - act on technical developments, like data spaces, Linked Data, the usage of AI and digital wallets, 
          but also storage and exchange of trip information using blockchain or 
          blockchain technologies (like DIDs).

```
Each API version can also contain extra functionality. Still, until the release of 'Elephant' we try to avoid breaking changes and they will be backwards compatible with the initial release of 'Dragonfly' (1.0).
