# Convention

In the specification, we use these 'coding conventions' in descriptions:
* <u>MODULE</u> - for the module names, like <u>PURCHASE</u>: capitals, spaces, underlined
* **conceptName** - referring to concepts that are described in the specification: capitals, spaces
* 'propertyName' - referring to fields/attributes/properties in a concept</td></tr>: bold, camel case
* ENUMERATION_VALUE - referring to values from specific properties: uppercase, underscores

* `URLs` - to specify a URL, referring to endpoints in the specification: between ticks
* _PROCESS_IDENTIFIER_NAME_ - see [Process Identifiers](https://github.com/TOMP-WG/TOMP-API/wiki/ProcessIdentifiers): italics, uppercase, underscores
* [conditions] - free format conditions for a specific line: between brackets

The actual specification uses the same convention.
