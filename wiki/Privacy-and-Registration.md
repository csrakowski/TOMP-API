# Privacy and Registration

The first operational block in the TOMP-API is the Privacy & Registration or deregistration block. This block offers the possibility for users to either delete, sign-up or log-in into their account with the MP. The TOMP-API would enable the possibility to use the customer account with a specific TO to log-in into the MP system.
