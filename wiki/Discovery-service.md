The discovery service is a role in a MaaS ecosystem, telling at least where everyone operates ('yellow pages'). This role can be fulfilled by a National Access Point (in Europe).  

## Optional roles
More advanced versions of a discovery service also provide functionality (roles) about:
* governance (are participants (MPs/TOs) allowed to operate in their claimed area)
* authentication (validate a requesting party; is it really who it is claiming to be)
* authorization ("how owns the data and who is allowed to use it")
* registration of other MaaS ecosystem roles ([Clearing house](Clearing-house.md)s, [Personal Data Store](Personal-Data-Store.md)s, other discovery services, etc.)  

These functions can be added, since they are closely intertwined with the registration of MaaS participants.
