# Radiuz
## Description
Radiuz is a mobility integrator platform that has been on the Dutch market for 10 years. Radiuz has integrated 20 different transport operators based on traditional interfaces.
Radiuz offers the mobility platform as a B2B solution to large corporates and as a white label solution to stakeholders that have their own B2B customer base (e.g. ANWB, MultiTank Card).

Radiuz has a licence to operate with all PTO in the Netherlands through Translink.

Radiuz was involved in multi modal trip planning software in 2010 – this was simply too early and the distribution rights have been used to develop the government funded Brabant OV app.
Ultimately 80% of the Dutch PTO used a white label version of this trip planner.

Radiuz has been awarded the MaaS Amsterdam Zuidas project – together with Over Morgen, Amber and Transdev. 
Radiuz is offering support to Transport Operators that are willing to connect through the TOMP API by means of a GAP Analysis and a commercial proposal.

# Amaze
## Description
Amaze is the joint venture that will deliver a true MaaS solution meeting the requirements of users and employers.
Amaze will be an open platform for all Transport Operators to connect provided that the TOMP API has been used.
