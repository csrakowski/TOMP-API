# Reference implementations

To facilitate a quick and smooth implementation, several examples, explanations and step-by-step guidelines are provided in the TOMP-API Wiki page (https://github.com/TOMP-WG/TOMP-API/wiki).


As a result, during the past few months, several parties (both TOs and MPs) have started to implement the TOMP-API. These implementations however have been in most cases limited in scope and/or adaptations of the intended standard. On the other hand, none of the implementers has encountered major impediments with the implementation of the TOMP-API.

To have an overview of the latest implementations, the TOMP Working Group conducted an internal survey to explore the level of implementation among members of the group. A summary of the results of this survey is presented in table 9 below:

|What|Type|Amount|
|---|----|---|
|Type of implementer|Bike Rental|3|
||Car Rental|4|
||Public Transport|3|
||MaaS Provider|4|
|MP vs TO|Nr. of TOs|7|
||Nr. of MPs|4|
|Type of project|Commercial Pilot|70%|
||Reference Implementation|20%|
||Other|10%|
|Multiple TOs behind a single API||40%|
|Communication|Peer-to-peer|90%|
||Router|30%|
||Unclear|10%|
|Security|Custom|70%|
||None|30%|
