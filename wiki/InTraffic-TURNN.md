# InTraffic
## Description
InTraffic has a two propositions. The first one is multimodal trip planner that is offered via an API to MaaS providers. With parameters such as starting location and destination, along with preferences, a multimodal trip is provided. Modalities consist out of the ones that are connected to our trip planner. The second proposition is the trip follower, also offered via an API to MaaS providers. When an end user books a complete and multimodal journey, that journey is saved in our trip follower that will monitor the trip. When there is, for instance, a disturbance, the trip follower communicates back to the user what that is and might include an alternative journey.
