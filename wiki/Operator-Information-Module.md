# Operational Information

As a summary of the data exchanged provided by the TOMP-API calls, Fig. 4 shows an overview of the data setsâ€™ blocks and units exchanged between the TOs and MPs.

The operator information endpoint should contain all necessary information about the operator, this information can be summarized in the following categories : 

* Regions
* Stations
* Available assets
* Alerts
* Calendar / opening hours
* General information
* Pricing plans, these are extended with TOMP objects (to represent conditions like max fares, scales etc)
