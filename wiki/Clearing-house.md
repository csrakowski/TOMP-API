A clearing house is a role in a MaaS ecosystem. It will allow the transferral of money between MaaS participants, f.x. from MP to TO.  

A clearing house should have at least 4 functions:
* registrate the willingness to pay for a leg in a trip to a specific TO
* validate the willingness to that TO
* registrate the actual costs for that leg by that specific TO
* take stock on a frequent base: what is the amount of money that should be transmitted  

## Optional roles
A clearing house can also facilitate in these roles:
* price calculator (in case of multiple legs in one trip & all participants are working together with this CH)
* travel right stock (a big stock of tickets/access data, accessible for the MPs and TOs involved by a specific leg)
