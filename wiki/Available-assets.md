The available assets are returned in "families": assets that are more or less the same. We call these "families" assetTypes. Per asset type the available number of assets is reported, together with the common aspects of the assetType. 

| field | required | description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| id    | * | Unique identifier of an asset type, descriptive or generated by the TO.  |
| stationId | | If stationId is present, the nrAvailable contains the available number of assets at that particular station
| nrAvailable | | 
| assets | | this object is also used in the response of the planning. In that case, this field can contain specific assets. If you want to provide information about specific assets in the /operator/available-assets, you must be aware of the GDPR aspects. The id must not be traceble. |
| assetClass | * (<=1.2.0) | These classes are taken from the NeTeX standard, but ALL and UNKNOWN are removed. On the other hand OTHER and PARKING are added. AIR, BUS, TROLLEYBUS, TRAM, COACH, RAIL, INTERCITYRAIL, URBANRAIL, METRO, WATER, CABLEWAY, FUNICULAR, TAXI, SELFDRIVE, FOOT, BICYCLE, MOTORCYCLE, CAR, SHUTTLE, OTHER, PARKING, MOPED, STEP |
| assetSubClass	|  | a more precise classification of the asset, like 'cargo bike', 'public bus', 'coach bus', 'office bus', 'water taxi', 'segway'. This is mandatory when using 'OTHER' as a class. |
| sharedProperties | * (<=1.2.0) | containing all common aspects of the assets in this assetType. Whenever you supply assets (planning result), you can override aspects per asset. Fx: you have an assetType based on color (e.g. 'Yellow bikes') and only one of them has purple stripes, you can still deliver this specific asset in this assetType. |
| applicablePricings | | Added in 1.3.0, to facilitate 'price per asset type' |
| conditions | | Added in 1.3.0, to facilitate 'conditions per asset type', like requesting a driver license |

# Providing number of available bike docking places (or other parking spaces)
In case you need to show how many available docking places there are at your station, you can leverage the asset type to provide this information as well and return it along available assets (bikes in case you are a bike operator). For example:

```
[
  {
    "id": "bike",
    "stationId": "123",
    "nrAvailable": 2,
    "assetClass": "BICYCLE",
    "assetSubClass": "pedalBike",
  },
  {
    "id": "ebike",
    "stationId": "123",
    "nrAvailable": 1,
    "assetClass": "BICYCLE",
    "assetSubClass": "ebike",
  },
  {
    "id": "bikeDock",
    "stationId": "123",
    "nrAvailable": 6,
    "assetClass": "PARKING",
    "assetSubClass": "bikeDock",
  }
]
```

This shows that station `123` has 2 pedal bikes, 1 e-bike and 6 docking places available.
