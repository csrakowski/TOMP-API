**Q:** What should be send in the planning as price? The agreed price between TO and MP or the consumer price?<br>
**A:** if you have agreements between TO an MP, this price should be used, but it must always be marked “estimated”: “true” in the planning, because the trip isn’t finished yet and the price can change.<br><br>

**Q:** Is there a possibility to make payment happen directly from end user to TO?<br>
**A**: One of the main thoughts of the TOMP API is that there is no direct contact needed between the end user and the TO. Therefore payments from the end user should be going to the MP and the TO will receive payments from the MP.<br><br>

**Q:** And what about existing arrangements (contracts, discount cards etc.) between the end user and the TO?<br>
**A:** the API facilitates in supplying this information in the planning call (cardType)
