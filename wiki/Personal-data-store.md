The personal data store contains personal information about the end-user. The end-user should be in full control of his data. The [MyData](https://mydata.org/.md) initiative guidelines should be applied.  

The current status of this is, that most MPs register users and store their information. When a TO needs some of this information, it can be requested by the MP. We assume that this will be the same situation in the upcoming year, but to anticipate, the MPs could implement the [PDS-M API](https://github.com/TOMP-WG/PDS-M.md). TOs still can request personal information, but now in a standardized way. Shifting to another location with the same personal information will be easier later on.  

This opens also up the possibility to 'roam': hopping from one MaaS 'island' to another.
